# üì¢ News Credibility AI

News Credibility AI is an AI-powered fact-checking system that verifies the authenticity of news and claims. It leverages **FastAPI**, **Perplexity AI (Sonar LLM)**, and **Twilio WhatsApp API** to provide fact-checking services via a REST API and WhatsApp bot.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **Fact-Checking API**: Accepts user queries and evaluates their authenticity.
- üîç **Credibility Scoring**: Assigns a confidence score (1-10) based on verified sources.
- üìñ **Reasoning & Sources**: Provides explanations with supporting evidence.
- ü§ñ **WhatsApp Integration**: Users can send news queries via WhatsApp for verification.
- üåç **Cross-Platform Availability**: Accessible via REST API and messaging platforms.

## How It Works

1. The user submits a news claim via WhatsApp.
2. The system fetches relevant sources and evaluates the claim.
3. It returns:
   - A **verdict** (‚úÖ Authentic / ‚ùå Fake or Misleading)
   - An **authenticity score**
   - A **reasoning explanation**
   - Verified **sources**
